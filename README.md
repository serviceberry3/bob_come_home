Welcome! This is a Flask site served by nginx->gunicorn on a vagrant VM running on a home server. Scheduled to go up sometime in February. Long live Bob. If you have a suggestion for a different domain name, email me at noah.weiner@yale.edu. So far here are some other names I'm considering:  
* bobthebestbuilder.com
* longlivebob.com
* hereliesbob.com

# UPDATES #
* 09/08/21: The site is now up at ![bobthebuildr.co.uk](bobthebuildr.co.uk). Must be connected to YaleSecure network to access it, for now. Use Firefox or Chrome.
